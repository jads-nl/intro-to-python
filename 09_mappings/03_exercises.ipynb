    "It is considered *bad practice* to make a function and thereby its correctness dependent on a program's *global state*: For example, in the \"*Easy at second Glance: Fibonacci Numbers*\" section in [Chapter 9 <img height=\"12\" style=\"display: inline-block\" src=\"../static/link/to_nb.png\">](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/webartifex/intro-to-python/blob/develop/09_mappings/02_content.ipynb#\"Easy-at-second-Glance\"-Example:-Fibonacci-Numbers--%28revisited%29), we use a global `memo` to store the Fibonacci numbers that have already been calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "That `memo` dictionary could be \"manipulated.\" More often than not, such things happen by accident: Imagine we wrote two independent recursive functions that both rely on memoization to solve different problems, and, unintentionally, we made both work with the *same* global `memo`. As a result, we would observe \"random\" bugs depending on the order in which we executed these functions. Such bugs are hard to track down in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common remedy is to avoid global state and pass intermediate results \"down\" the recursion tree in a \"hidden\" argument. By convention, we prefix parameter names with a single leading underscore `_`, such as with `_memo` below, to indicate that the caller of our `fibonacci()` function *must not* use it. Also, we make `_memo` a *keyword-only* argument to force ourselves to always explicitly name it in a function call. Because it is an **implementation detail**, the `_memo` parameter is *not* mentioned in the docstring.\n",
